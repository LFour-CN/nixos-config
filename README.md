# nixos-config
# My personal-used NixOS configuration

  To use it, you have to clone these files and copy them as root to your /etc/nixos directory.
  
# For Hyprland configuration
  
  Just copy the config files to your user directory ~/.config , For wallpapers, you should copy the to your home directory.

# Notice
  1. For nixvim, I use Lazyvim to manager my plugins, also, I chanage some config like keys and dashboard, see nixos/user/nixvim.nix.
  2. For Emacs, I use "home.file" to config it(all in one), see nixos/user/emacs/init.nix.
